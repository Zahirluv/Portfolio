				<h3>About Me</h3>
			 <p>Well, as it is one of the first times I am trying to put my life through the series of words. Trying to explain the perspective of how I see the world through my pair of lenses. I doubt that I will hardly do justice to this project So, I presciently  ask  pardon  for  my  callowness  regarding  the  context  of  this project. I also must mention that this is the first real frontend project I have done. My name is Zahir Wani and I am from Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. I am 22years of age; currently I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in philosophy major. Before that I had to dropout from a college and also had to pause my studies after a grievous incident inside the family. I had to put my commerce degree at hold and work as an assistant accountant at a small firm for a year to help and support my family. But I could not see myself quitting my degree halfway, and that is when I finally decided to enroll myself again for bachelor's in philosophy as a private student which gave me satisfaction not to think about classes while on work. Now I can learn however I like and also get to do the part time.</p>
			 <p>As being a tech geek since a child I was always aware about what is really going on inside the tech industries regardless that my own subjects had very little concern with it. I attempted to learn python all on my own without anyone's recommendation for 3-4 months but fond it really hard to cope with my 9 - 5 job. When  finally it hit me that I can be serious about learning development as it goes to those with interest in it which I had in tons. So, as I was already thinking about putting python on a pause when I got to know about nodeJs I knew javaScript is the language I must learn next. Doing some research on internet and applying at few learning platform. I got a call from one of the edwisor agents two months ago. I decided to go for this program and here I am today with my first portfolio site that I created myself. i also know it is very basic and there is still a lot of stuff I need to figure out but I am still proud of it anyway. </p>
			 <p>As the world is rapidly grows through all the sectors but nothing like how the tech has been growing since last couple of decades. the new ideas, out of the box thinking has multiple times proven to be revolutionary. The tech giants have to some extent realized that not only someone with a stem degree is capable of providing a valuable ideas for the benefit of the whole company at times .which has led to the cases where the tech giants have started to look for the people to hire who has the degrees in humanities. Now and then they have been sprinkling with the experiments of having individuals like artists and writers persons with much creative minds to fill the gaps in the understanding of the system. as having a serious interest in learning the programming . I really think I can learn anything if given a proper guidance and with my own dedication. As  a fact. Everyone had to learn it all as a newbie at a point no one came to this world already knowing it all. i really need a chance to unlock my true potential. I  might have very little achievements right now but surely I know it is not going to remain the same.  </p>
